This formula manages your firewall using iptables with pillar configured
rules. Thanks to the nature of Pillars it is possible to write global
and local settings (e.g. enable globally, configure locally)

ofcourse!)

== Usage

=== Default usage

All the configuration for the firewall is done via the pillar (see the
pillar.example file).

Enable globally:

`pillars/firewall.sls`

[source,yaml]
----
firewall:
  enabled: True
  install: True  
  strict: True
----

Allow SSH:

`pillars/firewall/ssh.sls`

[source,yaml]
----
firewall:
  services:
    ssh:
      block_nomatch: False
      ips_allow:
        - 192.168.0.0/24
        - 10.0.2.2/32
----

Apply rules to specific interface:

[source,yaml]
----
firewall:
  services:
    ssh:
      interfaces:
        - eth0
        - eth1
----

Apply rules for multiple protocols:

[source,yaml]
----
firewall:
  services:
    ssh:
      protos:
        - udp
        - tcp
----

Allow an entire class such as your internal network:

[source,yaml]
----
whitelist:
  networks:
    ips_allow:
      - 10.0.0.0/8
----

Salt combines both and effectively enables your firewall and applies the
rules.

Notes:

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
* Setting install to True will install `iptables` and
`iptables-persistent` for you
* Strict mode means: Deny *everything* except explicitly allowed (use
with care!)
* block_nomatch: With non-strict mode adds in a "REJECT" rule below the
accept rules, otherwise other traffic to that service is still allowed.
Can be defined per-service or globally, defaults to False.
* Service names can be either port numbers or service names (e.g. ssh,
zabbix-agent, http) and are available for viewing/configuring in
`/etc/services`
* If no `ips_allow` stanza is provided for any particular ruleset
instead of not adding the rule the addition itself is scoped globally
(0.0.0.0/0)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

=== Using iptables.service

Salt can't merge pillars, so you can only define `firewall:services` in
once place. With the firewall.service state and stateconf, you can
define pillars for different services and include and extend the
iptables.service state with the `parent` parameter to enable a default
firewall configuration with special rules for different services.

`pillars/otherservice.sls`

[source,yaml]
----
otherservice:
  firewall:
    services:
      http:
        block_nomatch: False
        ips_allow:
          - 0.0.0.0/0
----

`states/otherservice.sls`

[source,yaml]
----
#!stateconf yaml . jinja

include:
  - iptables.service

extend:
  iptables.service::sls_params:
    stateconf.set:
      - parent: otherservice
----

=== Using iptables.nat

You can use nat for interface. This is supported for IPv4 alone. IPv6
deployments should not use NAT.

[source,yaml]
----
# Support nat
# iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -s 192.168.18.0/24 -d 10.20.0.2 -j MASQUERADE

nat:
  eth0:
    rules:
      '192.168.18.0/24':
        - 10.20.0.2
----

== Configure the firewall using `tables`

The state `iptables.tables` let's you configure your firewall iterating
over pillars defining rules and policies to add to the different tables
(filter, mangle, nat) instead of using services. This way, you can
configure iptables the _classic way_. Note that you still need to
include the `iptables` state.

To enable the 'tables' mode, set:

[source,yaml]
----
firewall:
  use_tables: True
----

and then add rules to configure iptables. Check the `pillar.example`'s
_table_ section to see some examples.

== IPv6 Support

This formula supports IPv6 as long as it is activated with the option:

[source,yaml]
----
firewall:
  ipv6: True
----

Services and whitelists are supported under the sections `services_ipv6`
and `whitelist_ipv6`, as below:

[source,yaml]
----
services_ipv6:
  ssh:
    block_nomatch: False
    ips_allow:
      - 2a02:2028:773:d01:10a5:f34f:e7ff:f55b/64
      - 2a02:2028:773:d01:1814:28ef:e91b:70b8/64
whitelist_ipv6:
  networks:
    ips_allow:
      - 2a02:2028:773:d01:1814:28ef:e91b:70b8/64
----

These sections are only processed if the ipv6 support is activated.

== Testing

Linux testing is done with `kitchen-salt`.

=== Requirements

* Ruby
* Docker

[source,bash]
----
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ bin/kitchen test [platform]
----

Where `[platform]` is the platform name defined in `kitchen.yml`, e.g.
`debian-9-2019-2-py3`.

=== `bin/kitchen converge`

Creates the docker instance and runs the `iptables` main state, ready
for testing.

=== `bin/kitchen verify`

Runs the `inspec` tests on the actual instance.

=== `bin/kitchen destroy`

Removes the docker instance.

=== `bin/kitchen test`

Runs all of the stages above in one go: i.e. `destroy` + `converge` +
`verify` + `destroy`.

=== `bin/kitchen login`

Gives you SSH access to the instance for manual testing.
